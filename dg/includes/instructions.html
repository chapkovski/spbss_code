        <p>
            You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
            In this study, one of you will be {{Constants.dictator_role}} and the other
            {{Constants.recipient_role}}. Prior to making a decision, you will learn your role,
            which will be randomly assigned.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is {{ Constants.endowment }} to split. {{Constants.dictator_role}} will
            decide how much she or he will retain. Then the rest will go to
            {{Constants.recipient_role}}.
