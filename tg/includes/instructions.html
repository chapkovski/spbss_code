        Instructions
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        One of you will be selected at random to be {{Constants.sender_role}};
        the other will be {{Constants.receiver_role}}.
        You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any
        decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start, {{Constants.sender_role}} receives {{ Constants.endowment }};
        {{Constants.receiver_role}} receives
        nothing.
        {{Constants.sender_role}} can send some or all of
        his {{ Constants.endowment }} to {{Constants.receiver_role}}.
        Before {{Constants.receiver_role}} receives this amount, it will be multiplied
        by {{ Constants.multiplier }}. Once {{Constants.receiver_role}} receives
        the tripled amount he can decide to send some or all of it to
        {{Constants.sender_role}}.
