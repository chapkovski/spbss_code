                For the following questionnaire you will receive a small additional payoff. However, this payoff is not
                the same for every participant. You determine your own payoff by throwing your die twice as soon as you
                are asked to.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Your first throw decides on how much you receive. You can see the exact payoff
                from the following chart. It will remain on the screen until you have entered your throw.
            </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">
                <table class="table">
                    <tr>
                        {% for i in Constants.payoffs.keys %}
                        <td>{{i}}</td>
                        {%endfor%}

                        <td>{{j}}</td>

            <li class="list-group-item" The second throw only serves to make sure that the die is working properly. You
                may of course throw the die more than twice. However, only the first throw counts.
